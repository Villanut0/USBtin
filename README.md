# USBtin USB to CAN interface clone

USBtin is a simple USB to CAN interface. It can monitor CAN busses and transmit CAN messages. USBtin implements the USB CDC class and creates a virtual comport on the host computer.

This PCB is a clone of the original project : [USBtin](https://www.fischl.de/usbtin/)

It is almost the same as the original PCB. I made it to be able to mill it easily on my cheap milling machine.

## Features
* 65x32mm
* Single sided PCB with only 2 straps
* Same through-hole components as the original project ([Partlist](https://www.fischl.de/usbtin/#partlist))

3D printed enclosure is available on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3976971)
